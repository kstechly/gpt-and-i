        "Using each of the numbers 2 2 2 8 exactly as many times as they appear in the list and the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /), it is possible to write an expression that evaluates to 24. Please check if the following expression uses only the correct numbers (and no others) and evaluates to 24: (8 / 2) * (2 + 2) = 4 * 4 = 16\n\nCorrection needed. I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's try again.\n\n(2 * 2 * 2) + 8 = 16.\n\nApologies, this doesn't equal 24 either.
