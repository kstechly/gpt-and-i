        "Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. You must write your response. Write your answer first, followed by [ANSWER END]\nInput: 1 1 3 11\nAnswer: ",
        "Using each of the numbers 1 1 3 11 exactly as many times as they appear in the list and the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /), it is possible to write an expression that evaluates to 24. Please check if the following expression uses only the correct numbers (and no others) and evaluates to 24: To obtain 24 using the numbers 1, 1, 3, and 11, we can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Multiply 3 and 11:\n   \\( 3 * 11 = 33 \\)\n   \n2. Subtract the two 1s from 33:\n   \\( 33 - 1 - 1 = 31 \\)\n\n3. To adjust to 24, we can't directly reach there with these operations. Instead, let\u2019s try another approach:\n\n1. Add 11 and 1:\n   \\( 11 + 1 = 12 \\)\n   \n2. Then multiply by 3:\n   \\( 12 * 3 = 36 \\)\n\n3. Finally, subtract the other 1 from 36:\n   \\( 36 - 1 = 35 \\)\n\nHowever, these approaches also do not give the desired result of 24.\n\nAfter recalculating the possible combinations, I found that if instead I do:\n\n1. Calculate:\n   \\( (11 - 1) = 10 \\)\n\n2. Multiply by 3:\n   \\( 10 * 3 = 30 \\)\n\n3. Subtract 6 (two 1s):\n   \\( 30 - 6 = 24 \\)\n\nTo finalize my operations involved, I arrived at utilizing both numbers effectively.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\( (11 - (1 + 1)) * 3 = 24 \\)\n\nThus, my response remains:\n\n(11 - (1 + 1)) * 3 = 24\n\n[ANSWER END]\nIf it is not correct, please give feedback on what is wrong and how to correct it.\nRespond only in JSON format as described below:\n{\n   \"feedback\": \"feedback\",\n   \"correct\": boolean}\nEnsure that Python's json.loads can parse this.",
