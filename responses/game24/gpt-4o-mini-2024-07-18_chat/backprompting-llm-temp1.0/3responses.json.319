        "Using each of the numbers 3 7 7 12 exactly as many times as they appear in the list and the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /), it is possible to write an expression that evaluates to 24. Please check if the following expression uses only the correct numbers (and no others) and evaluates to 24: One possible solution to obtain 24 using the numbers 3, 7, 7, and 12 is:\n\n(12 - 7) * (7 - 3) = 5 * 4 = 20\n\nHowever, this doesn't yield 24. Let me try another approach.\n\n(7 - (3 / 3)) * 7 = (7 - 1) * 7 = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(7 - 3/3) * 7 = 24\n\nMy earlier steps contained errors; my proper end solution:\n\n(7 - 3) * 7 - 12 = 24\n\nBut as the above also doesn't yield 24 directly.\n\nAfter reevaluation, using straightforward arithmetic expressions:\n\n3 * (12 / (7 - 7)) = 24\n\nAgain, that would lead to infinite since it becomes zero in division.\n\nThere are accurate paths to find 24, eg:\n\n(7 * 3) + (12 - 7) = 21 + 3 = 24\n\nThus, expressing optimally the result is:\n\nAnswer: (7 * 3) + (12 - 7) = 24 [ANSWER END]\nIf it is not correct, please give feedback on what is wrong and how to correct it.\nRespond only in JSON format as described below:\n{\n   \"feedback\": \"feedback\",\n   \"correct\": boolean}\nEnsure that Python's json.loads can parse this.",

The expression (7 - 3/3) * 7 also does not make sense as 3 / 3 evaluates to 1, leading to (7 - 1) * 7 = 6 * 7 = 42, which is incorrect. Additionally, your final expressions have errors; (7 * 3) + (12 - 7) is correct and evaluates to 24, but there are also other ways to do this using provided numbers accurately.
