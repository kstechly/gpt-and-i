Furthermore, the expression '6 * (4 - 1)' suggests using the number 4 which is not in the original list of numbers (1, 2, 3, 6). You need to create an expression that uses each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 exactly once to evaluate to 24. A correct expression is '6 * (2 + 3)' or '6 * 4' where 4 can be constructed from 2 * 2 which is not valid since all numbers must be sourced from the original set. An example of a valid expression is '(6 / (1 - (2 / 3)))' is incorrect, it evaluates to 18 instead of 24. One correct alternative is '6 * 4' but sourced incorrect numbers.
