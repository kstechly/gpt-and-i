        "Using each of the numbers 3 8 9 10 exactly as many times as they appear in the list and the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /), it is possible to write an expression that evaluates to 24. Please check if the following expression uses only the correct numbers (and no others) and evaluates to 24: To obtain 24 using the numbers 3, 8, 9, and 10, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with (10 - 8) = 2\n2. Then multiply it by 9: 2 * 9 = 18\n3. Finally, add 3: 18 + 3 = 21\n4. Adjust by adding 3 to another operation to get 24.\n\nHowever, a cleaner selection would be:\n\n1. Use the multiplication of 3 and 8: 3 * 8 = 24.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nAnswer: 3 * 8 = 24 [ANSWER END]\nIf it is not correct, please give feedback on what is wrong and how to correct it.\nRespond only in JSON format as described below:\n{\n   \"feedback\": \"feedback\",\n   \"correct\": boolean}\nEnsure that Python's json.loads can parse this.",
